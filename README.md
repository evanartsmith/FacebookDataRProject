# FacebookDataRProject

Analyzing a dataset of psuedo Facebook data to get a better understanding of R and the packages that are used for statistical analysis and Data Science. Below are a few of my graphs that I was able to make with the GGplot2 package which include Histograms, Line graphs, Bar Graphs, and a few others included in the R project code.
